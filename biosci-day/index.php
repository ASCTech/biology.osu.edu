<h1>Hello and welcome to The Ohio State Universityâ€™s BioSci Day website!</h1>

<p>Helix/Tri&ndash;Beta, the Biological Sciences Honorary society, will host
	 our annual information day, &quot;Bio&ndash;Sci Day&quot; at The Ohio
   State University. This event will be held on Saturday, March 3, 2012,
   from 10:00am to 2:00pm. Lunch will be provided from a few of the campus
	 dining halls.  For an agenda

<p>We have structured BioSci Day so you can explore majors and other
   academic options, interact with faculty and staff advisors, and meet
   current students. Please

<p>We will hold BioSci day in the auditorium of Jennings Hall on the main
   campus. Parking is available at the Neil Avenue garage. Maps and
   directions to campus are
   <a href="biosci-day/directions.php">available here</a>.  On the morning
   of March 3, we will also have student guides positioned at the major
   entrances to campus to guide you to the Neil Avenue garage and to
   Jennings Hall.</p>

   you, please feel free to contact us at
