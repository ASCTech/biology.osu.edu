<p>We study EGF receptor signaling in Drosophila development focusing mainly on the ligand called Vein, which by similarity is the fly neuregulin. Neuregulins are activators of the erbB receptors in vertebrates and play important roles in development and disease. We are currently characterizing the mechanisms that control biological activity of Vein. The promoter region is being analyzed and this has revealed a significant&hellip;
