<h1>Honors Biology 116</h1>
<h1>SAMPLE SYLLABUS</h1>

<h2>UTAs:</h2>
<p>Undergraduates TAs will be assisting the GTAs in laboratories and recitations. Check the web page
   for information on how to contact your UTA(s).</p>

<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>Biology H116 follows Biology H115. In this course we deal mainly with the organismal and
   supra-organismal levels of biological organization. Evolution is the consolidating theme. The
   diversity, form, function, and ecology of organisms will be covered, with particular emphasis on
   plants and animals.</p>

<h2>Format:</h2>
<p>Lectures: 11:30 am, MWF, Biological Sciences 668</p>
<p>Recitation: 1 hour/week</p>
<p>Laboratory: 3 hours/week</p>

<h2>Texts:</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Biology (2002, 6th edition), by Campbell & Reece</li>
 <li>Biology 114 Laboratory Manual</li>
 <li>Guns, Germs, and Steel: The fates of human societies, by Jared Diamond</li>
</ul>
<p>Tests will cover lecture material, not the Campbell text. I recommend you read Campbell for
   preparation, background, further information, review, MCATs, etc., but, beyond lecture material,
   you will be tested only on those parts of the book I specifically tell you in lecture to read.
   We will read and discuss Guns, Germs, and Steel in recitation, and material that overlaps the
   lecture may appear on exams.</p>

<h2>Recitations:</h2>
<p>Recitation assignments will be announced and/or handed out ahead of time.</p>

<h2>Laboratories:</h2>
<p>Labs marked by asterisks in the following schedule are covered in the lab manual; for the rest,
   handouts will be provided. Reports will be due according to schedule.</p>

<h2>Grading:</h2>
<p>The course will have two midterms, each worth 100 points, and a comprehensive final worth 150
   points. The laboratory will have approximately five exercises or write-ups (25&ndash;40 points
   each), and a lab practical (100 points). There will also be points associated with recitation.
   Your letter grade will be based on the percentage of points you obtain and will follow the
   customary break points (93% A, 90% A&minus;, 87% B+, 83% B, 80% B&minus;, etc.). If at the end
   of the quarter I deem the grade distribution too low, I will adust the grading scale. Make-up
   exams may be taken only in cases in which absence from the exam is unavoidable, such as in cases
   of illness or family emergency (this must be documented). Exams must be made up within a week.
   Please let me know if you are a graduating senior and need to take the final early.</p>

<h2>Late Assignments:</h2>
<p>The point value for assignments turned in late will be reduced by 5% per day late.</p>

<h2>Change of grades:</h2>
<p>You are responsible for making sure the grades we have are correct. Verify your grades
   periodically on Carmen. You have two weeks after a grade is posted to request a change or
   re-grading.</p>

<h2>Academic Misconduct:</h2>
<p>I expect students to abide by the Code of Student Conduct given in the University Student
   Handbook. Plagiarism, cheating on exams, etc., will be dealt with as provided for in this
   Handbook</p>
