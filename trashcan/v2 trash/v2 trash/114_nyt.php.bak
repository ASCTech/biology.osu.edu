<h1>Biology 114: New York Times Clippings Project</h1>
<h2>Procedure: (50 points)</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
 <li><p id="undent">Select a topic for your project:</p>
     <p>To start this project, you will pick an issue of interest to you from among many you will
        find covered in The New York Times. You may want to look at back issues of The Times and
        recent magazines to identify a topic you find interesting. You may also want to gather
        background information from books and other publications, the Internet, and elsewhere. Your
        topic must be relevant to material being covered in Biology 114.</p>
     <p>It is better to start with a broad topic that you can narrow down later if you wish. For
        instance, by starting with a subject such as &quot;Evolution,&quot; you are sure to find a
        sufficient number of related articles over the course of the quarter. By the time you are
        ready to begin writing your paper, you may need to narrow your subject to a particular facet
        of evolution, for example, the social implications of evolution. The Tuesday edition of The
        New York Times contains a special science section.</p></li>
 <li><p id="undent">Confirm with your TA that the subject is appropriate for your course: (NYT
        assignment I: 7 points)</p>
     <p>Submit two paragraphs that briefly discuss why you have chosen the subject and how it
        relates to the course curriculum. List the resources you have consulted for background
        information.</p></li>
 <li><p id="undent">Clip relevant articles from The New York Times:</p>
     <p>Clip any articles, editorials, columns, letters to the editors, or other items that address
        your topic. Keep in mind that news stories are intended to convey the basic facts of a
        topic, while the other types of articles weigh competing opinions and points of view. You
        will need to include at least 3 recent New York Times articles in your project's final
        bibliography. Date and identify each item by page(s) and column(s). For example, write A1:1
        to identify an article that begins on page 1 of section A, in the first (left-hand) column.
        To indicate that the article continues on page A18 in the second and third columns, write
        A18:2,3. You may want to group clippings not only chronologically, but also by the narrower
        subjects that are addressed. You may also want to highlight portions of the clippings that
        you find especially interesting or pertinent. Also, look for any items under
        &quot;corrections&quot; on page A2 that may refer to the articles you have clipped.</li>
 <li><p id="undent">Supplement the materials you have found in The Times with other sources:</p>
     <p>Draw on other publications such as books and magazines, radio or television news programs,
        and the Internet to supplement the information you found in The New York Times.</p></li>
 <li><p id="undent">Submit a progress report to your instructor: (NYT Assignment II: 3 points):</p>
     <p>Include a bibliography of sources you have used to date and indicate whether you have
        narrowed the subject matter or shifted your original approach.</p></li>
 <li><p id="undent">Complete one of the following projects. (NYT Assignment III: 40 points):</p>
  <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
   <li><u>Analysis of the development of the issue over a discrete time frame (3&ndash;4 pages)</u>
       <p>Write a brief introduction to your topic/issue, then analyze your subject and discuss how
          it has evolved since you began clipping articles. Refer to governmental, political, social
          and economic forces that were involved.</p></li>
   <li><u>Opinion review (3&ndash;4 pages)</u>
       <p>Write a brief introduction to your topic/issue, then discuss the various viewpoints of
          individuals and organizations involved whose opinions appear either in pieces on the
          Op-Ed page or in quotations included in news stories. You may wish to use other resources
          to include additional perspectives. In either case, your essay should include complete
          citations as footnotes. Indicate the source (e.g., name of publication, radio program,
          web site, etc), its date, page (if appropriate), and column(s) in the case of newspapers
          and magazines, etc.</p>
