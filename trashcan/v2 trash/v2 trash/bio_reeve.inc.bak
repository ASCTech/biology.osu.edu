<p>Archaea are prokaryotes, many of which are unusual and live in extreme environments, such as the
   boiling water surrounding volcanic vents, in saturated salt solutions, and in the complete
   absence of oxygen. We are investigating the molecular biology of methane-producing Archaea that
   grow at temperatures up to 98&deg;C. We have the sequenced the genome of a thermophilic
   methanogen and discovered that the expression of many genes involved in methane biosynthesis is
   regulated by environmental hydrogen availability. We are now determining, at the molecular
   level, how hydrogen&hellip;
