<h2>Prerequisites:</h2>
<p>Required: Biology 101 or equivalent (including high school AP biology) or instructor’s

<h2>Course Philosophy:</h2>
<p>This course will employ the &quot;case study&quot; approach. Rather than concentrating briefly
   on a number of topics, we will focus on four major areas of biology that raise particularly
   perplexing policy options. We will accomplish this as a team of faculty researchers and guest
   speakers who bring international expertise to these areas:</p>
<ol>
 <li>DNA, Genes, Chromosomes and GMOs:
  <ol>
   <li>DNA, genes, chromosomes and gene expression: Dr. Sayre</li>
   <li>Human Genome, Eugenics and Human Cloning; Dr. Sayre</li>
   <li>Genetically Modified Foods in Developing Nations; Dr. Richard Sayre, Dr. Dimuth Siritunga,
       Dr. Allison Snow</li>
  </ol>
 </li>
 <li>Evolution:
  <ol>
   <li>Introduction, Dr. Richard Sayre</li>
   <li>Evolution and Religion, Dr. David Ruppe</li>
  </ol>
 </li>
 <li>Human Disease:
  <ol>
   <li>Obesity, Dr. Richard Sayre</li>
   <li>Bio-terrorism, Mr. Matt Misicka</li>
   <li>Nutraceuticals and Cancer, Dr. Gary Stoner</li>
  </ol>
 </li>
 <li>Ecology and the Environment:
  <ol>
   <li>Invasive Species and the Great Lakes, Mr. Doug Haddix and Mr. Michael Hawthorne, Columbus
       Dispatch</li>
   <li>Toxicology, Dr. Roman Lanno</li>
   <li>Global Warming, Dr. Peter Curtis</li>
   <li>State of Ohio, Mr. Matt Misicka</li>
  </ol>
 </li>
</ol>

<h2>Assignments and Grading:</h2>
<p>Seven basic types of assignments will be employed throughout the quarter. These assignments will
   be done individually or collaboratively as described in the Recitation Schedule. Detailed
   assignment descriptions are located on Carmen. Point values for these assignments will also be
   described in recitation. Lecture outlines, but not detailed notes, also will be posted on
   Carmen.</p>
<table id="syllabus">
 <tr>
  <td>One &quot;problem statement&quot; (1 page maximum)</td>
  <td>25 points</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Two &quot;option statements&quot; (2 page maximum)</td>
  <td>2 &times 50 points = 100 points</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>One &quot;preferred policy statement&quot; (5 page maximum)</td>
  <td>75 points</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Seven Daughters of Eve; in recitation writing assignments</td>
  <td>4 &times 25 points = 100 points</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Lecture/readings quizzes following each lecture module</td>
  <td>4 &times; 25 points = 100 points</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Recitation activities administered by your recitation teaching assistant</td>
  <td>100 points</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>New York Times Project</td>
  <td>7 articles (weeks 3&ndash;9) = 50 points</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Total number of points</td>
  <td style="border-top: 1px solid black">500 points</td>
 </tr>
</table>
<p>Grades will be based upon the standard OSU grade distribution for A, A&minus;, B+, B, B&minus;,
   etc.</p>

<h2>Important Course Tools:</h2>
<p><strong>Carmen:</strong> We anticipate that you will check this site regularly for schedule
   changes, assignment guidelines, and other information. Brief, one page lecture outlines will be
   posted following each lecture presentation. Your teaching assistant can help you activate your
   account if you are unfamiliar with this software.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Textbook:</strong> Available on Carmen. This digital course packet is intended to
   provide you with readings that will serve you as a foundation for development of your
   assignments. It will also help focus your search for additional references throughout the
   quarter.</p>
<p><strong>The New York Times:</strong> Your source for the latest breaking news in science. While
   you can &quot;get&quot; it online, you have to work hard to stay on top of it; you can also
   read/photocopy it in many libraries. One way or the other, you must have access to it.</p>
<p><strong>Center for the Study and Teaching of Writing (CSTW):</strong> Information will be
   provided regarding how you may benefit by using this resource during this course.</p>
<p><strong>Collaborative Learning:</strong> This is recognized as a highly effective teaching
   method. Its use for some assignments (above) is required.</p>
<p><strong>Other readings:</strong> Additional readings will be handed out and/or posted (including
   web sites) on the course website.</p>

<h2>A Word About Conduct in Large Classes:</h2>
<p>This is a large class, but you are not a small part of it! To make our time together as valuable
   as possible, we all have to work hard at it. The following basic principles may give us some
   guidelines:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Every student has the right to learn as well as the responsibility not to deprive others of
     their right to learn.</li>
 <li>Every student is accountable for his or her actions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>In order for you to get the most out of this class, please consider the following:</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
 <li>Attend all scheduled classes and arrive on time. Late arrivals and early departures are very
     disruptive. If you must be late or need to leave a lecture early, please sit in the
     balcony.</li>
 <li>Please do not schedule other engagements during either lecture or recitation. You probably
     wouldn't like it if we did! We will try to make class as interesting and informative as
     possible, but we can't learn the material for you.</li>
 <li>If you have trouble hearing the material presented in lecture because of distractions around
     you, quietly ask those responsible for the distraction to stop.If the distraction continues,
     please let us know. It is often impossible to hear such things from our position in the
     classroom.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Course Rules:</h2>
<ul>
 <li>
  <h3>Academic misconduct:</h3>
  <p>Plagiarism is not permitted; the OSU Policy on Academic Misconduct is in effect in this
     class.</p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <h3>Collaborative learning rules:</h3>
  <p>Unlike some classes, collaborative learning opportunities are not optional here. You are
     required to work as a group on some projects. You will be asked to evaluate your own
     contribution to group-prepared projects as well as the contribution of other group members.
     Dysfunctional groups will be provided assistance in learning how to work together to a
     reasonable degree.</p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <h3>Students with Disabilities:</h3>
  <p>Please contact Course Coordinator, Matt Misicka (688-3466, misicka.1@osu.edu), as soon as
     possible after the class starts to help us understand how we can best accommodate your needs.
     We have a good working relationship with the Office of Disability Services and are confident
     that all appropriate needs can be accommodated.</p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <h3>Section Changes:</h3>
  <p>All section changes and adds are done at the Introductory Biology Program office between 8:00
     AM and 4:00 PM at 4034 Smith Lab. In order to keep track of ongoing changes in section
     availability no other course personnel (the instructor, head TA, other TA's) can sign a change
     form.</p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <h3>Late Assignment Policy:</h3>
  <p>10% will be deducted from the graded assignment for each day, past the due date, that an
     assignment is late. After five (5) working days, no late assignments will be accepted.
     Exceptions may be made once with appropriate documentation (note from doctor, employer, clergy,
     etc.) for an excused absence.</p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <h3>Grade Inquiries:</h3>
  <p>Students will have ten (10) class days to challenge any grade/score presented on Carmen they
     feel may be incorrect or to inquire about any grades not posted. The posted grade stands as
     permanent if left unchallenged past the ten class-day period.</p>
