<h1>Honors Biology 115</h1>
<h1>SAMPLE SYLLABUS</h1>

<h2>Scheduling Issues:</h2>
<p>All requests to change section, add or delete the course, etc., are handled by the Introductory
   Biology Office (292-9861), 4034 Smith Laboratory, 174 W. 18th Avenue.</p>

<h2>Lecture and Recitation Grading Policies and Goals</h2>
<p>Exams will consist of short essay, multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank questions. Material will
   be drawn from the lectures (including the guest lectures) and the assigned readings in the
   textbook.</p>
<p>Recitation section quizzes and homework assignments will be based on material covered during the
   previous class lectures and reading assignments.</p>
<p>A major goal of this course is to demonstrate the relevance of biology to modern society. To help
   achieve this goal we included the following:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Invited guest speakers with expertise in specific areas at the interface of contemporary
     biology and society.</li>
 <li>A project based on regular reading of biology-related content in The New York Times. This
     project will involve collecting clippings of current articles, editorials, columns, letters to
     the editor and other items that address a topic of contemporary biological relevance to be
     determined in consultation with your TA. Additional details will be supplied on a separate
     handout.</li>
</ul>
