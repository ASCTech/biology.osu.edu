<h1>Biology 101: An Introduction to Biology</h1>
<h1>SAMPLE SYLLABUS</h1>

<h2>Class Format:</h2>
<p>The first part of each lecture will normally be spent on a &quot;What's News&quot; segment, in
   which we review issues of importance in biology that have appeared in The New York Times in the
   preceding days. The remainder of each lecture will typically be an informative lecture on one or
   more basic principles in biology. On Mondays there will be a weekly quiz. As it is impossible to
   predict what will appear in The New York Times on any given day, we cannot predict how large a
   proportion of the lecture time the &quot;What's News&quot; segment will consume. Thus, the
   lecture schedule that appears later in this syllabus should be considered tentative, and
   students need to remain current with course material to know what will be covered on the weekly
   quizzes.</p>
<p>The laboratory portion of this course is designed on the principle of inquiry-based science. Few
   of the laboratory exercises have pre-planned &quot;correct&quot; answers; rather, students will
   use their inquiry skills to investigate and develop insights into various aspects of biology.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites:</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Required: none. A high school biology course will be very helpful. Surveys conducted by the
     Introductory Biology Program indicate that approximately 98% of Biology 101 students have had
     a formal course in biology at some time.</li>
 <li>Recommended: A curiosity and fascination about the nature of life around you, belief that you
     can learn something interesting and relevant in a large class, ability to read The New York
     Times, any experience preparing food, and a sense of humor.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Philosophy:</h2>
<p>This course is designed to teach the science of biology by doing biology. I believe the content
   of biology is best learned (as opposed to memorized) within the processes of biology. I will
   strive to demonstrate how major questions in biology have been addressed, and I will provide you
   with opportunities to participate in this process. At the end of this course I hope to have
   increased your fascination with biology and further developed your abilities to reason within
   this and other areas.</p>
<p>The course schedule should be considered tentative. I reserve the right to add or subtract time
   devoted to a given exercise in accordance with the overall goals of the course.</p>

<h2>Required Materials:</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Biology 101 Laboratory Manual (available at all bookstores and on Carmen)</li>
 <li>Essential Biology by N.A. Campbell and H.B. Reece, 2001, Addison Wesley Longman, Inc.
     (available at all bookstores)</li>
 <li>The New York Times (information given out in class)</li>
 <li>Internet Access (Carmen is an integral part of this course. You must activate your OSU email
     account to have access to Carmen.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Course Contract:</h2>
<p>As my part of this learning contract I will:</p>
<ul>
 <li>accept joint responsibility with you for your learning</li>
 <li>emphasize thinking processes in addition to products. Readings and quizzes will help you
     organize the content of this course</li>
 <li>present some of the best examples of the nature of science as demonstrated in biology</li>
 <li>consider and value your feedback in and after this course</li>
 <li>attempt to model patience throughout the course</li>
 <li>strive to make this an interesting and exciting course</li>
 <li>do everything I can to make this very large class a personal learning experience for you,
     including using cooperative learning opportunities in lab, visiting the labs to participate in
     that part of your learning, and offering opportunities to meet to discuss course material or
     anything else of interest to you</li>
 <li>arrive in the lecture hall before class starts, and leave only when the class is over and you
     all have left</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the learning contract you accepted by enrolling in this course, I expect you to:</p>
<ul>
 <li>accept joint responsibility for your learning</li>
 <li>work to understand all exercises, readings, and labs designed to help you organize the content
     component of this course</li>
 <li>demonstrate patience throughout</li>
 <li>do everything you can to make this class a personal learning experience by participating
     effectively in cooperative learning opportunities and contacting me whenever necessary</li>
 <li>show respect to fellow students by participating in lecture and laboratory exercises without
     being disruptive</li>
 <li>arrive in the lecture hall before class starts and leave only when the class is over</li>
 <li>do nothing to distract others from the presentation of the course in lecture and lab</li>
</ul>

<h2>Grading:</h2>
<p>Your mastery of material presented in the lectures and readings will be assessed on the basis of
   200 points, as follows:</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Lecture Quizes:</strong> There will be eight lecture quizzes. Five of them are worth 20
     points, two are worth 30 points and the one given during the last class of the quarter is worth
     40 points. These will be multiple choice quizzes and will be given during the last third of
     class (200 points total). Each quiz will contain questions from The New York Times articles
     that are required reading (and are posted on Carmen), the lecture material, and the information
     in the required readings in the text.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your mastery of laboratory exercises will be assessed on the basis of 250 points:</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Lab Exercises:</strong> Each lab exercise will be graded on a 20 point scale (180
     points total).</li>
 <li><strong>Group New York Times Project:</strong> Each cooperative lab group will assemble and
     submit a set of no less that six articles from the New York Times that are linked in such a way
     as to produce an integrated treatment of some issue in biology. The six articles and a
     type-written narrative of three pages discussing this issue will be due during lab in week 8 of
     the quarter. All members of the cooperative learning group will receive the same grade for the
     project. This project will be graded on the basis of 40 points.</li>
 <li><strong>Lab and Lecture Participation:</strong> Your participation in lecture, lab exercises
     and cooperative learning opportunities will be monitored by your lab instructor and graded on
     the basis of 30 points.</li>
<p><strong>Final Grades:</strong> Your final grade will be based on the percentage of the 450 points
   that you earn during the quarter, as indicated below.</p>
<table id="gradescale">
 <tr><th>Percent</th><th>Grade</th></tr>
 <tr><td>93 &ndash; 100</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A</td></tr>
 <tr><td>90 &ndash;  92</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&minus;</td></tr>
 <tr><td>87 &ndash;  89</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B+</td></tr>
 <tr><td>83 &ndash;  86</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B</td></tr>
 <tr><td>80 &ndash;  82</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B&minus;</td></tr>
 <tr><td>77 &ndash;  79</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C+</td></tr>
 <tr><td>73 &ndash;  76</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C</td></tr>
 <tr><td>70 &ndash;  72</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C&minus;</td></tr>
 <tr><td>67 &ndash;  69</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D+</td></tr>
 <tr><td>63 &ndash;  67</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D</td></tr>
 <tr><td>0  &ndash;  62</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E</td></tr>
</table>
<p><strong>NOTE 1:</strong> Carmen does not round averages up to the next nearest percentage point,
   so 92.11% and 92.99% totals both earn the grade of A&minus;.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE 2:</strong> I reserve the option to curve the final distribution of grades up; I
   will not curve them down.</p>
<h3>Posting of Grades:</h3>
<p>All grades will be posted on Carmen; you will have 10 working days to challenge any grade or
   inquire regarding any unposted grade; after that time, grades are final.</p>

<h2>Absences:</h2>
<p>Missed quizzes must be made up within a week of the date they were originally given. If you must
   miss a quiz for a university-sanctioned event, you must supply appropriate documentation no less
   than one week before the event. If you are too ill to take a quiz, please contact your lab
   instructor as soon as possible, and also consult FAQ on the website. Written documentation from
   a professional health care practitioner will be required before a make up is given. Persons
   arriving late for weekly quizzes will not be offered a quiz after the first person has handed in
   a completed quiz. Make up quizzes will typically be a combination of short answer and essay. No
   unique senior final will be necessary as all final lecture and lab assignments will be completed
   by the Thursday of the last week of classes. The laboratory portion of this course is an integral
   part of the learning experience; missing three or more labs will result in the student being
   automatically assigned a failing grade for the course.</p>
