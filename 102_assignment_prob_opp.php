<h1>Problem/Opportunity Statement</h1>

<h2>Objective:</h2>
<p>Students are expected to capture the problems/opportunities associated with the case study,
   presented in lecture, in a one-page statement.</p>
<p>This paper is to be written as if the students were on the staff of a senator/congressional
   representative. Students are asked to thoroughly, yet concisely, describe the
   problems/opportunities (biological concerns that suggest the need for establishing a public
   policy) associated with the case study. The paper should present a balanced view of the
   problems/opportunities the case presents. It should include a brief description of the history,
   current status, and consequences of inaction with regards to the topic. The information provided
   must be accurate and demonstrate an understanding of the issues and terminology. As a reminder,
   your audience is not a scientist, but demands correct information. A senator's time (and
   attention span) is very limited, so you must capture her/his attention with concise writing.</p>
<p>The paper should exhibit a logical flow of information. The opening paragraph should establish a
   clearly focused controlling idea, indicating the intended direction of the paper. Every
   paragraph should begin with a sentence that either suggests the topic of the paragraph or
   provides a smooth transition. Meanderings and unnecessary repetitions should be eliminated.</p>
