<h1>Steve Chordas</h1>
<b>Biography:</b>
<img style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em;" src="images/chordas_football.jpg" />
<p>Senior Lecturer for the Center for Life Science Education.  I now have
   the grey hair to appropriately fit the "senior" part of my title.  For 7
   years I worked as Public Health Entomologist (Ohio Department of Health)
   concentrating on Vector-Borne Diseases in Ohio.  I have been teaching
   Biology 101 and Biology 102 at Ohio State since just before the turn of
   the century!  My research interests are primarily with Insects
   (specifically Hemiptera "Bugs", Odonata "Dragonflies" and Coleoptera
   "Beetles").  I study taxonomy, biogeography, toxicology, community
   ecology and diversity.  Identification manuals for many Ohio Hemiptera
   groups are in the works.  Currently completing the Thyreocoridae (Black
   Bugs) of Ohio.  I also am involved in several Arkansas Hemiptera
   projects.</p>
