<h1>Biology 102: Human Biology &ndash; A Case Studies Approach</h1>
<p>In this course, emphasis is placed upon understanding the interaction between science and
   biotechnology and the social and philosophical implications of its implementation as public
   policy. By intimately exploring a small number of diverse biological case studies, we hope to
   foster a greater understanding of science and its impact on contemporary society. Additionally, we
   hope to enhance the awareness of, and respect and appreciation, for the ideas of others within the
   larger world community.</p>
<p>The primary tool of this approach will be reading and writing related skills. (Basic computational
   skills [placement level R or Mathematics 075] will aid student comprehension of the concepts
   presented in the course.) With these skills in mind, we will attempt to expose students to
   critical thinking, writing, oral expression and teamwork. Students will be taught to recognize the
   problems of data-gathering, interpretation and presentation. They will be expected to illustrate
   their ability to view issues from multiple sides, weigh evidence objectively and develop valid
   arguments.</p>
