<h1>Professor Steve Chordas</h1>
<b>Biography:</b>
<img style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em;" src="images/chordas_lg.jpg" />
<p>In addition to teaching for IBP, I am a full time Public Health Entomologist for the Ohio
   Department of Health. We primarily do surveillance and testing for Vector-Borne Diseases in Ohio.
   We track outbreaks or incidence of diseases like West Nile Virus, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever,
   you know &ndash; the fun stuff! Anything you can get from an arthropod, we are interested in
   investigating and testing them to see if the disease is present in the vectors in Ohio. My
   research interests are primarily with Aquatic Insects. In particular with Hemiptera
   &quot;Bugs&quot;, Odonates &quot;Dragonflies&quot; and Coleoptera &quot;Beetles&quot;. I study
   taxonomy, biogeography, toxicology, community ecology and diversity. Identification manuals for
   Ohio are in the works for these groups of aquatic insects. I am currently in the process of
   describing 2 new species of Hemiptera. The terrestrial Hemiptera have also begun to grab my
   attention and I now have several projects involving the land bugs!!</p>
