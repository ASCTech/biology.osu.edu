<h1><center>Short Writing Assignment: Exploring References</center></h1>
<p><u>Objective</u>:</p>
<p>To start thinking about references/sources and credibility.</p>
<p>Students are expected to develop two questions related to the case study that they, as
   congressional staffers, would want answered before proceeding in making policy recommendations to
   their senator. Students should perform the following with each question:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Record the question.</li>
 <li>Search electronically via any preferred means (OSCAR, EBSCO, Lexus/Nexus, Google, Yahoo, etc.)
     for articles/reports/conversations focusing on the question.</li>
 <li>Select an article that seems particularly useful/informative.</li>
 <li>Name the database(s) where you found the resource.</li>
 <li>Provide a complete citation for the article using MLA or APA formatting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Write a brief summary describing:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The article's content with respect to the posed question,</li>
 <li>Evidence or details used to support this idea,</li>
 <li>The author's credibility (Who is the author? What qualifications lend credibility to her/his
     argument?)</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Grading Criteria</u>:</p>
<p>For full credit, this assignment must meet the following guidelines for each question:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Fit the format guidelines presented in recitation: 12 point Times or Arial font, 1.5 line
     spacing, 1" margins.</li>
 <li>Match the case study.</li>
 <li>Name the database(s) used in the search.</li>
