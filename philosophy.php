<p>The curriculum of Biology 101 has been altered completely and now conforms with current calls
   for teaching scientific literacy to all students better than almost all other such programs in
   the country. All laboratory exercises have been rewritten completely to emphasize hands on
   learning, critical inquiry, a learning cycle approach to learning, collaborative learning and a
   student-centered approach to learning. Individual faculty freedom at achieving these goals is
   emphasized with no &quot;mandatory syllabus.&quot; The Director encourages 101 instructors to use
   the insights of the course coordinator and follow the general syllabus of other instructors while
   &quot;personalizing&quot; their course. The Director introduced a reformed syllabus in Winter
   2000, and virtually all 101 instructors have followed this syllabus with numerous, innovative (and
   unanticipated) variation.</p>
<p>The curriculum of Biology 102 has been split to provide an educational choice for non-majors.
   Those students whose majors of interests demand a &quot;traditional&quot; &quot;Human Biology&quot;
   course can still take the existing course (now numbered Biology 102.01).</p>
<p>An alternative approach to Biology 102, &quot;Human Biology: A case studies approach, Biology
   102.02&quot; was developed in Spring 2000 and has run every winter and spring quarter since then.
   The course uses a &quot;Master of Ceremonies&quot; instructor who invites and coordinates the
   presentations of up to four &quot;Specialist Faculty&quot; who present background information on a
   relevant topic on which students, working in collaborative groups, must prepare policy papers (in
   our model: for United States Senators on whose staffs they are serving as student interns. Forty
   percent of the grade comes from collaborative work (requiring extensive training of the GTA's on
   how to encourage effective collaborative work) and 60% from individual writing assignments. There
   are no memorization exams. We believe this is the largest science GEC course based completely on
   writing of its kind in the country.</p>
<p>The curricula of our majors and honors courses were regarded as in less critical need for reform
   in 1999. While all courses have benefited from reforms described here, the lab-by-lab reform of
   Biology 113 has only started in Fall of 2002 but will proceed based upon the wealth of insights we
   have gained by reforming Biology 101 and 102.</p>
