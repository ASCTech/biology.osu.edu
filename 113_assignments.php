<h1>Biology 113 Sample Assignment</h1>
<h1><center>Long Lab Report<center></h1>
<p>The Biology 113 lab report is written in the form of a scientific paper like those seen in a
   scientific journal. The format of a scientific paper is different than other papers you have
   written in English class or other writing courses. A scientific paper follows the general form of
   the scientific method of forming a hypothesis, testing the hypothesis by an experiment, then
   interpreting the results to see if they do or do not support the hypothesis. The purpose of a
   scientific paper is to communicate to others the results of an experiment and what the data mean
   according to the author's interpretation. (Note that &quot;data&quot; is plural and requires a
   plural verb in a sentence. A single bit of information is a &quot;datum,&quot; which is rarely
   used.)</p>
<p>Correct spelling and proper English are required in a scientific paper (lab report). Wording must
   be clear and concise in order for a reader to easily understand all aspects of an experiment. A
   scientific paper usually consists of a title and five standard sections presented in a specific
   order without a table of contents. This same format is required for the lab report. Requirements
   of the title and all sections are described below. Section headings are centered on the page. The
   heading of a following section always immediately appears at the end of the previous section; do
   not start a new page. An example of a lab report is posted on Carmen under the lab info icon to
   give you an idea of overall structure and content.</p>
<p>The major items you should include in each section of your report are listed below along with
   their point value out of a total of 20 points. Your TA will grade the lab report by looking for
   these specific items within each section. Therefore, you are likely to receive a good score if you
   closely follow the guidelines. Typing the report is required; five points are deducted from any
   hand-written report received. Points are also deducted for grammar and spelling with the deduction
   depending on how poorly the lab report is presented (five point maximum penalty).</p>

<p><u>Title (1.5 points)</u></p>
<ul>
 <li>Factor(s) manipulated in experiment (0.5)</li>
 <li>Specific aspect of subject that was focus of experiment (0.5)</li>
 <li>Specific name of subject involved in experiment (0.5)</li>
</ul>
<p>The title of your report must be very clear and descriptive. The title alone should reveal what
   the experiment involved without having to read any part of the lab report. A general title such as
   &quot;Biology 113 Lab Report&quot; is pointless; it tells nothing about the content of the paper.
   An example of a good self-explanatory title would be: &quot;The Effects of Variable Food Supply on
   the Reproductive Success of Captive Crayfish (Orconectes rusticus).&quot; The title states three
   important points:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Factor(s) manipulated in the experiment &ndash; food supply.</li>
 <li>Specific aspect of subject that was the focus of the experiment &ndash; reproductive
     success.</li>
 <li>Specific name of subject involved in the experiment &ndash; Orconectes rusticus</li>
</ul>
<p class="undent">The title would be insufficient if any one of these points were omitted or incomplete
   requiring reading of the paper in order to fully understand what the experiment involved.</p>

<p><u>Introduction (2 points)</u></p>
<ul>
 <li>Introduction of subject involved in experiment (0.5)</li>
 <li>Introduction of experiment (0.5)</li>
 <li>Statement of hypothesis(es) (1)</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of the introduction is to familiarize the reader with the experiment. This section
   should include some background information that directly relates to the project to &quot;set the
   stage&quot; for the experiment. Using the crayfish experiment mentioned above as an example, a
   brief description of the crayfish and its life cycle presented with statements of how
   environmental factors are known to affect crayfish reproduction would be appropriate. Such
   background information gives the reader a better sense of how the experiment relates to what is
   already known about crayfish reproduction. The library, Internet and course texts are sources of
   such information. Material from such sources used in your lab report must be referenced (cited) to
   indicate that those statements are from other authors and not your own words. A section on how to
   correctly cite information sources appears below. Please know that failure to cite information
   sources is academic misconduct, which must be forwarded to the Committee on Academic Misconduct as
   required by OSU regulations.</p>
<p>The introduction should present a brief overview of the experiment to give the reader a general
   idea of what the project involved and what the investigator (you) was trying to accomplish.
   However, do not reveal too much detail about the mechanics of the experiment. The &quot;nuts and
   bolts&quot; of the project are presented in the &quot;Materials and Methods&quot; section
   described below.</p>
<p>One of the most important points of the introduction is the presentation of the hypothesis tested
   by the experiment. The hypothesis must be stated because it is the entire purpose of the
   experiment. Present the hypothesis in a clearly worded sentence or short paragraph that tells
   exactly what was suggested as a tentative outcome of the experiment.</p>

<p><u>Materials and Methods (4.5 points)</u></p>
<ul>
 <li>Detailed and complete description of experimental setup and all materials (2)</li>
 <li>Thorough description of procedures (2)</li>
 <li>Presentation of the above in narrative form (no lists) (0.5)</li>
</ul>
<p>In this section you explain specifically how you did all work of the experiment. This includes
   description of the experimental design, all equipment and reagents (chemicals) used, methods of
   gathering data, any mathematical or statistical treatment of the data and the type of control used
   in the experiment. The lab manual or other document that presents the experiment is the best
   source for this section. Drawings and diagrams can be used in describing the experimental set up.
   All figures must be labeled according to &quot;Use of Tables and Figures&quot; presented below.
   The &quot;Materials and Methods&quot; section should be detailed and clear enough that a reader
   would be able to duplicate the experiment solely from information presented in your paper.</p>
<p>This section, and all other sections of the lab report, should be written in the past tense
   because the experiment has been completed at the time of writing. The lab report is essentially a
   story that describes all hardware aspects of the experiment and tells all activities done during
   the project. However, the &quot;Materials and Methods&quot; section should not be written as
   though it were directions in a lab manual. For example:</p>
<blockquote>First pour nutrient agar into six petri plates, let cool, then inoculate the plates with
   fungus. Then put the plates into an incubator, incubate for 12 hours at 37&deg;C and check for
   growth.</blockquote>
<p class="undent">Do not make a list of items required for the experiment. For example:</p>
<blockquote>For this experiment you will need the following equipment: 6 petri plates, 1 liter
   nutrient agar, inoculating loops, etc.</blockquote>
<p class="undent">This, too, reads like a page from a lab manual. In a correct &quot;Materials and
   Methods&quot; section, all items used in the experiment are simply presented in the text of the
   lab report as the procedures are explained in detail.</p>

<p><u>Results (3.5 points)</u></p>
<ul>
 <li>Data table positioned within text of lab report (1.5)</li>
 <li>Reference to data table in text of lab report (0.5)</li>
 <li>Correct labeling of table (0.5)</li>
 <li>Description of significant results in table/figures within text (0.5)</li>
 <li>Absence of conclusions (0.5)</li>
</ul>
<p>The sole purpose of this section is presentation of data from the experiment in a straightforward
   manner. Presentation of the data in table form is required, and the table must appear within the
   text of the lab report. Do not simply staple a table page onto the back of your report! Since each
   lab group is to use only their own data as the basis for the lab report, it is important that this
   specific information be presented in the data table.</p>
<p>In addition to a table, you may wish to present the data in the form of a line or bar graph that
   helps the reader to quickly interpret the data. All tables and figures must be labeled according
   to &quot;Use of Tables and Figures&quot; presented below.</p>
<p>Whenever you use a table and/or a graph, it must be referred to and described within the text of
   the lab report. A &quot;Results&quot; section containing only a table or graph with no descriptive
   text to accompany it is not acceptable. The text should describe the results in the table or graph
   and call attention to what you consider to be the significant data you will write about in the
   discussion section. For example, descriptive text might read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>The results of the temperature experiment are shown in Table 1. The amount of fungal
   growth increased up to 40&deg;C, then decreased sharply at higher temperatures.</blockquote>
<p class="undent">Here the author is calling attention to what she/he considers as significant
   results.</p>
<blockquote>The greatest amount of fungal growth occurred between 37&deg;C and 40&deg;C.</blockquote>
<p>Although the author points out significant data in the table, note that she/he resists explaining
   how or why the results turned out as they did. The author also refrains from stating if the data
   do or do not support the hypothesis. Such conclusions belong in the discussion section.</p>

<p><u>Discussion (6 points)</u></p>
<ul>
 <li>Presentation of a definite, clear conclusion (3)</li>
 <li>Explanation of why the experiment supports or does not support the hypothesis (3)</li>
</ul>
<p>This section more than any other is the &quot;meat&quot; of your lab report. Be sure to clearly
   present a definite conclusion of the experiment based upon the meaning of the data presented in
   the &quot;Results&quot; section. In addition, explain why you reached your conclusion by
   presenting what you think the results mean. Describe any patterns you may have noticed in the
   data, or any relationships you think were meaningful in the experimental results. Be sure to
   explain how you think the results support, or do not support, your original hypothesis. Include
   any explanations as to why you think the experiment turned out differently from the way you
   expected, if it did so. For example, equipment failed during the project, a certain reagent was
   forgotten in the procedure, etc. In effect, you defend your point of view about the experiment in
   the &quot;Discussion&quot; section.</p>

<p><u>Literature Cited (2.5 points)</u></p>
<ul>
 <li>Appearance of citation sources in both text of lab report and this section (1.5)</li>
 <li>Correct alphabetical listing of sources (0.5)</li>
 <li>Correct format (0.5)</li>
</ul>
<p>This section lists in alphabetical order, by author, all published or online material referred to
   (cited) anywhere in the text of your lab report. It provides readers with the information they
   would need to locate the published materials if they wanted to do a literature search about the
   topic of your experiment. Note that the &quot;Literature Cited&quot; section includes only those
   references that were actually cited in the text of your lab report. Any other information that you
   may have read concerning the topic, but did not cite in the paper, is not included in this
   section. This is why the section is called &quot;Literature Cited&quot; instead of
   &quot;References&quot; or &quot;Bibliography.&quot; Students commonly list their information
   sources in this section, but fail to cite them within the text of the lab report. Be sure to cite
   information from a source where it appears in your paper. Below are examples of the format used in
   this section.</p>
