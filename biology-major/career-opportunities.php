<p>Some areas of biology are currently acknowledged to be hot areas in
   science. They are:</p>
<ul>
 <li>genetics</li>
 <li>molecular and cell biology</li>
 <li>biotechnology</li>
 <li>medical research</li>
</ul>

<p>Biology students often continue in careers such as
   research scientist or college professor, perhaps in one of these hot
   fields. For these careers, students must first obtain a Ph.D.
   degree. More often, a biology student goes on to a career in
   medicine or some other health science. In the private sector, a
   master's degree may be sufficient for a research or product
   development position.</p>

<p>Those students who are not looking for a career in research or a
   health profession may seek to move into other science careers such
   as communications, business (pharmaceutical sales), school teaching,
   or a myriad of jobs (e.g., in nature centers or as a government
   biologist or science writer). Some biology majors are eager to go
   out and find a job in the science arena before continuing graduate
   work for a master's or Ph.D. degree. The positions that these
   particular students find are usually those of research assistant,
   field assistant, or laboratory assistant. Such a student should
   visit the <a href="http://career.asc.ohio-state.edu/">Arts and
   Sciences Career Services Office</a> in 05 Brown Hall long before
   commencement day to perfect job seeking skills.</p>

<p>Whether the biology graduate has a Ph.D., master's, or a bachelor's
   degree in biology, if work is found in the field of biology, it is
   most likely going to be found in the key economic industries of
   health, food, environment, pharmaceuticals, or education.</p>

<p>In general, jobs for graduates with master's degrees involve more
   responsibility and higher pay. For positions designing or directing
   research projects, a Ph.D. is a must.</p>
