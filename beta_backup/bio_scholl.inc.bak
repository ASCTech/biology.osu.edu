<p>Ribosomal protein (RP) genes have been studied extensively in E. Coli, yeast and animals. Many
   genetic traits are associated with RPs: Resistance to trichothecene mycotoxins is conferred by
   ribosomal protein L3 (RPL3) of yeast, and the minute phenotype of Drosophila is the result of
   mutant RPs. Since trichothecenes are produced by some plant pathogenic fungi, we are studying
   Arabidopsis ribosomal protein L3 (ARP). Our previous studies have shown that there are three
   members of the ARP family, one of which (ARP1) is very abundant &hellip;
