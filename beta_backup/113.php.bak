<h1>Biology 113: Gateway to the Biological Sciences</h1>
<p>As with any introductory course, a primary goal of Biology 113 is to provide science major
   students with a sound basis in basic biological concepts that will serve them well in their
   academic track that lies ahead. Biology 113 presents the molecular and cellular aspects of
   biology that include DNA structure and gene function, Mendelian inheritance, cell structure,
   function and reproduction along with related energy pathways of photosynthesis and cellular
   respiration. The course also presents an introduction to early animal development. Faculty from
   several departments within the College of Biological Sciences teach Biology 113 on a rotating
   basis. Each instructor contributes her/his own individual teaching style, ideas and experience to
   the course.</p>
<p>Biology 113 is currently in a gradual state of development that will ultimately fulfill several
   goals of the Introductory Biology Program (IBP). Current lab exercises that are more traditional
   in format are scheduled for replacement by inquiry method lab work where students form their own
   hypotheses, test them for validity through experimentation of their own design and interpret the
   results as a basis for a conclusion. Related to this lab method is IBP's plan to implement a
   learning cycle approach in the lecture hall. Students first encounter biological topics and
   concepts in the laboratory by the exploratory manner described above, which the professor later
   expands and develops in lecture period &mdash; the inverse sequence of events usually seen in
   traditional teaching. And although no sooner than sometime in 2007, the complete renovation of
   Jennings Hall will give Biology 113 pristine, new laboratory rooms that are definitely worth the
   wait!</p>
