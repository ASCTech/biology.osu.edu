<h2>Text/Materials</h2>
<p><em>Biology: Concepts and Applications (7<sup>th</sup> edition)</em> by Starr, &copy; 2008, (available at all bookstores) &ndash; ISBN 0495119814</p>
<p>Biology 101 Lab Manual 2007&ndash;2008, The Ohio State University</p>
<p><em>New York Times</em>: student subscription information available on Carmen (carmen.osu.edu)</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The major goal of this course is to provide you with a foundation of
   principles that are central to biology. Through the study of these core
   concepts the nature of scientific inquiry will be reinforced. These goals
   are in-line with the goals and objectives of the GEC Natural Science
   category. (outlined below)</p>

<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>You will achieve a sound understanding of core concepts in biology. Some
   new terms and ideas will be introduced but as much as possible you will not
   be expected to memorize facts and figures. The information presented will
   also prepare you to make sound life choices related to biology, e.g. Are
   genetically modified foods safe to eat? This course is designed to provide
   you with the foundation of knowledge to discuss and evaluate such topics,
   which will be the focus of Biology 102. Thus Biology 101 will provide the
   framework of knowledge you need for life science future courses and biology
   related decisions. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Students will recall current and historical aspects of energetics,
      genetics, evolution, and ecology. Students will describe biological
      processes related to energetics, genetics, evolution, and ecology.
      Students will analyze the current and future significance of energetics,
      genetics, evolution, and ecology on society.</li>
  <li>Students will apply skills that demonstrate their scientific literacy by
      communicating about the content and validity of articles related to
      science in the popular press.</li>
  <li>Students will value the study of biology.</li>
  <li>Students will demonstrate an understanding of the nature of science.
      This includes (1) the way that scientist develop and evaluate
      explanations of natural phenomena using criteria fundamental to
      scientific inquiry and (2) the understanding that science is a human
      endeavor.</li>
  <li>Students will work productively and effectively in a group.</li>
</ul>

<? require 'courses/GEC.inc'; ?>

<p>In Biology 101, non-major Biology students meet the GEC Natural Science
   Learning Objectives in multiple ways. Students gain an understanding of the
   foundations of modern biology by studying organismal diversity, evolution,
   ecology, energetics, genetics, reproduction, and cell structure and
   function. The students will perform inquiry-based laboratory activities
   that provide insight into scientific methods and habits of mind. Lectures
   and labs will include references to the development of scientific concepts
   to help students understand the history and nature of science. The
   interactions among science, technology, and society are interwoven
   throughout the course, and assignments give students opportunities to
   personally consider the interactions. Biology 101 is designed to help
   prepare students to make intelligent, informed decisions on the biological
   and technological decisions that they will face in life.</p>

<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The class will meet 3 times per week for 1 hour and 48 minutes each session
   for lecture. The content of the lecture is determined by the laboratory
   activity that week. Lecture time will be used to reinforce the concepts
   that were introduced in lab and to expand upon those concepts. A mixture of
   lecture and group discussion/activity formats will be used. Participation
   by all members of the group in the activities is expected. In addition to
   lecture notes you will be asked to respond to specific questions or
   problems. Most of these will be group activities, but a few will require
   individual responses. These will be collected and graded.</p>
<p>Laboratories meet twice weekly for approximately 3 hrs. The lab activities
   are central to the course, as lecture will generally be used to explain and
   discuss the preceding lab. Each laboratory period includes a recitation
   period during which questions can be answered and concepts from the lab can
   be reviewed. Review your lab manual for lab policies and procedures.</p>

<h2>Materials</h2>
<p>The text will be used to provide background information and to clarify
   points made during lecture.  I recommend it highly as my lectures follow it
   fairly closely.  The free On-line text – Kimball’s Biology Pages can be
   used in place of the text.  It is excellent but does go into most topics in
   more depth than I will. Using it as a resource to supplement the lectures
   is the best approach. Additional handouts and web sites will be provided as
   needed.</p>
<p>Carmen is being used for this course to organize course material including
   grades, course syllabus, assignments and the pretest.  Before you can use
   Carmen you must activate your OSU email account. The URL for Carmen is
   http://carmen.osu.edu/ and Biology 101 should be listed under My Courses on
   your Carmen homepage.  The username is your OSU name.# and the password is
   the one you use with all OSU email and registration systems. If you have a
   problem logging in or using Carmen contact 688-HELP or carmen@osu.edu.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT: The CLSE and its course staff will only send email to
   your official OSU email account.</strong></p>

<h2>Grading:</h2>
<p>Lecture Grade (70% of final grade): Each of seven weekly quizzes will be worth 10 lecture points; the final exam will be worth 30 points. There are
   a total number of 100 lecture points.</p>
<p>Lab Grade (30% of final grade): Each laboratory exercise will be worth 100 lab points; the New York Times clippings project 50 lab points; teaching
   assistant discretionary points will be worth 50 points. There are 1000 total lab points.</p>
<p>Final Grade: Your final grade will be the sum of your total lecture points accumulated divided by 100 &times; 70%, and your total laboratory points
   accumulated divided by 1000 &times; 30%.</p>
<h3>Grades will be calculated on the basis of the above sum using the following formula guidelines:</h3>
<table id="gradescale">
 <tr><th>Percent</th><th>Grade</th></tr>
 <tr><td>93 &ndash; 100</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A</td></tr>
 <tr><td>90 &ndash;  92</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&minus;</td></tr>

 <tr><td>0  &ndash;  62</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E</td></tr>
</table>
<p>NOTE: I reserve the option to curve the final distribution of grades up; I will not curve them down.</p>

<h2>Absences:</h2>
<p>Missed exams/quizzes should be made up within a week of the normal exercise; if you are ill for an exam/quiz, please contact your teaching assistant
   as soon as possible (see also FAQ on website). If you miss an exam/quiz for a university sanctioned event, please inform us prior to your absence.
   Please provide a written excuse (e.g. note from a health care practitioner) for any missed lab/quiz. Late arrivals for quizzes will not be offered a
   quiz after the first person has handed in a completed quiz. Make-up exams and senior finals will usually be short answer or essay. Please notify the
   head TA by the seventh week of classes if you need to take a graduating senior final.</p>
<p>The laboratory section of this class is an integral part of the learning experience; missing three or more labs will result in a grade of incomplete
   or withdrawal.</p>

<h2>Grading Errors:</h2>
<p>All grades will be posted on Carmen; you will have 10 class days to challenge any grade, or to inquire about a grade that is not posted. After this
   the statute of limitations for appeal has expired, and any grade not posted remains a zero.</p>

<h2>New York Times Clippings Project:</h2>
<p>A major goal of this course is to demonstrate the relevance of biology to society today. Accordingly, you should turn into your laboratory teaching
   assistant each week an article from the last week of the New York Times with a brief paragraph written explaining the article and how it indicates
   the relevancy of its biological topic to society today. These will be graded full credit or no credit and are due at the start of each lab period
   starting with the second lab exercise of the quarter. The article you submit should be clipped from the paper itself, photocopied or downloaded (the
   New York Times is available in most libraries and online at <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">www.nytimes.com</a>).</p>
