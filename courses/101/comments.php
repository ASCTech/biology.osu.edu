<h1>Student Feedback and Comments on Biology 101</h1>
<p>The following are students comments after taking the Center for Life Sciences Education's Biology 101 Course:</p>
<ul>
 <li>&quot;&hellip; I was intrigued and made to think. This class is much better than I expected from Bio 101! Thanks!&quot;</li>
 <li>&quot;liked not having to memorize facts but learn concepts by looking at big picture and how WE are affected.&quot;</li>
 <li>&quot;best GEC class &hellip; prof. showed genuine interest in teaching.&quot;</li>
 <li>&quot;made lecture interesting to those not in biology&hellip;&quot;</li>
 <li>&quot;This is exactly what I expected &ndash; information on important, relevant topics, but not a boring repetition of what we already learned in
     previous bio classes in high school. It was a great class!&quot;</li>
 <li>&quot;I enjoyed my TA because she actually seemed interested in the subject and helping us.&quot;</li>
 <li>&quot;the fact that we got to do labs and get a little hands on with the subject.&quot;</li>
 <li>&quot;it was a very well done course that was very thought provoking and well put together.&quot;</li>
 <li>&quot;I liked how we were able to interact through our labs.&quot;</li>
 <li>&quot;was intellectually stimulating&quot;</li>
 <li>&quot;The course was set up nicely as a GEC. I did not have to spend an overwhelming amount of time studying and doing busy work for a course that has
     nothing to do with my major.&quot;</li>
 <li>&quot;lectures were interesting, and presented in a way that made you want to come to class&quot;</li>
 <li>&quot;I like how biology is mostly related to everything people deal with in life and gives you new insights to think about when dealing with life.&quot;</li>
